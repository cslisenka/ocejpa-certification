1. Play with Persistence unit, Persistence context, EntityManager, Transaction: 
1.1 open several EntityManagers, check if they return different objects => they have different contexts
1.2 Open EntityManager, open transaction, make some inserts,updates, do not commit tx, then use this EM in another thread and check we do not see transaction changes
1.3 Make subproject which will be deployed to JavaEE container and create Statefull, Stateless beans, create EntityMangers using @PersistenceContext, add maven plug-in for deploy to server
1.4 Make a rollback - see if entities are detached, what happens with primary keys?
1.5 Try to use @Version
1.6 Can we create managed entity in one context and then use this emtity in anither?
1.7 Detach entity and then try to access lazy-loaded relationships (relationships have cascade detach)
1.8 Try merge with cascade and without it. Load objects in one transaction, detach, change values, try to merge back.
!!!1.9 Create utility which prints which obtects belongs to specific context checkContext(EntityManager, Object...)
